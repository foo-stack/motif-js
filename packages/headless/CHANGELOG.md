# @usemotif/headless

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Feature release.
  - **Rich variants and styled context.** `styled()` base, variants, and compound variants now carry interaction (`_hover`/`_focus`/`_checked`/…) and motion (`transition`/`enterStyle`/`exitStyle`) styles, deep-merged across layers. New `createStyledContext` flows a parent's variant props down to sub-components.
  - **Imperative responsive.** Public `useMedia()` and `useBreakpoint()` hooks on web and native, re-rendering only when a breakpoint boundary is crossed.
  - **Configurable breakpoints.** The five breakpoint widths are now customizable at build time — a compiler `breakpoints` option plus `<ThemeProvider breakpoints={…}>` / `configureBreakpoints()` at runtime, with `configureViewportBreakpoints()` for the headless layer. `Adapt`/`Show`/`Hide` also accept an explicit pixel width in place of a name.
  - **Compiler.** New opt-in `optimizationLevel: 'aggressive'` tier (static-spread inlining, static-ternary extraction, `useMedia` erasure to CSS) with byte-for-byte runtime parity; the conservative tier stays the default. `@usemotif/compiler-swc` is renamed to `@usemotif/compiler-web`; the old package remains as a deprecated alias.
  - **Animation.** A Web Animations API driver for off-main-thread, interruptible enter and exit; unified driver selection across web and native; and asymmetric enter/exit timing.
  - **Adaptive UI.** The `Adapt` primitive shapeshifts a Dialog into a Drawer/sheet by breakpoint.
  - **Tokens.** A new soft-tint `status.{neutral,info,success,warning,danger}` intent group, with `Alert` refit to use it.
  - **New pseudo-states.** `_checked`, `_selected`, and `_expanded`.
  - **Components.** `@usemotif/recipes` (variant configs as data) and the `@usemotif/ui` kit, now around 50 themed, animated, adaptive components.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Patch release rolling up the fixes from a second full-codebase audit (issues #209–#278), plus a follow-up ReDoS hardening.

  Highlights:
  - **core**: custom-property names and `@keyframes`/`:root` selectors are escaped against CSS injection; the `_disabled` pseudo no longer leaks as a global `:disabled` selector; own-property guards across token, variant, and responsive resolution.
  - **compiler**: JSX/`styled` references resolve by binding identity (scope-shadow safe) with hardened literal evaluation; extraction bails when static props/pseudo bags collide with a dynamic prop, when a sibling motion prop is dynamic, or when `styled()` caller props are possibly-undefined; the SWC plugin serves aggregated CSS in Vite dev.
  - **react**: SSR without a collector now throws instead of leaking CSS through process-global dedup; the default `<Link>` underline is emitted as a class rule so hover/focus win; `styled()` ignores an explicit `undefined` variant value (falls through to `defaultVariants`); `<Stack stagger>` no longer reads reduced-motion at render (no hydration mismatch); `<Blockquote>` honours a `fontStyle` opt-out.
  - **react-native**: corrected transform identity/axis interpolation, easing, and imperative pause/resume; web→native style translation for `textDecoration`, per-side border styles, viewport units, font stacks, and percentage translate; `@usemotif/icons` render on native, with fixed RN package resolution and native accessibility roles/labels; the presence boundary no longer remounts the subtree when an exit animation starts, so descendant state and scroll position survive a close. **Security**: removed a polynomial-ReDoS in the `vw`/`vh` viewport-unit regex.
  - **headless**: overlay/menu focus order, positioning, and ARIA wiring corrected (DOM-order keyboard nav, ref-merged triggers, gated `aria-controls`); forms/selection/date-picker correctness — Select keyboard operability, controlled clearing via `'value' in props`, file-drop `accept`/`multiple` filtering, `addMonths` day-clamp, slider snap relative to `min`, color-channel clamping, and toast de-duplication; default option, empty-state, toast, and nav-item renderers wrap bare strings in `<Text>` so native components no longer crash on first use.
  - **tooling**: the `rename-v2` codemod is idempotent (a rerun no longer corrupts renamed imports); `publish.mjs` gained a downgrade and unparseable-version guard, and `verify-version-bump` fails closed on an unclassifiable bump.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Patch release rolling up 25 bug, accessibility, and cross-platform fixes from a full-codebase audit (issues #183–#207).

  Highlights:
  - **core**: unitless CSS props (`aspect-ratio`, `flex`, grid line props) now emit bare numbers instead of `1px`, restoring runtime/compiler output parity; fully space-delimited CSS Color 4 `rgba()`/`hsla()` (`rgb(255 0 0 0.5)`) parse for color interpolation; object-form value props such as `fontVariationSettings` are no longer mis-detected as responsive when a key collides with a breakpoint name.
  - **react**: a disabled `<Link>` no longer performs default browser navigation; `enterStyle` is no longer rendered during SSR (no FOUC, no hydration mismatch); `Avatar` falls back to initials for a cached/already-broken image; `useAnimate().finished` rejects on cancel per its documented contract; `ZStack` preserves each child's key; an orphaned `<Theme>` no longer re-renders every consumer each render.
  - **react-native**: a native style translator maps shadow tokens to native `shadow*`/`elevation`, array-izes literal `transform` strings, and drops web-only props; enter/exit animations interpolate toward each key's resting value (e.g. `opacity` → 1) instead of 0; native translate preserves percentage units.
  - **styled() (`usemotif`)**: `styled('button', …)` keeps the intended element type on React Native; an explicit `undefined` prop no longer erases a base/variant value.
  - **headless**: Popover closes on Escape when focus is on the trigger; DatePicker's trigger label updates in uncontrolled mode; nested NavigationMenu submenus collapse one level per Escape; MultiSelect detects a controlled value via `'value' in props`; Toast no longer double-announces; TreeView ArrowLeft climbs to the parent, the ColorPicker saturation/value plane is a slider with `aria-valuetext`, and FormatToggle gets roving-tabindex arrow-key navigation.
  - **compiler / build tooling**: extracted CSS aggregates in a deterministic order (reproducible builds); the literal extractor refuses to bake mutated `const` objects/arrays; query-suffixed module ids (`?v=`, `?used`) are transformed; a single malformed file no longer aborts the compile/codemod run; the tree-shaking check now fails when a target fails to bundle.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- b0719c1: Four a11y refinements. `Tooltip` content is now `pointerEvents: none` with no hover-keepalive — a `role="tooltip"` is not an interactive hover target (WAI-ARIA APG), so it can't be parked open by moving the cursor onto it (that behavior belongs to HoverCard). `CommandPalette` clamps the highlighted index during render, so a programmatic `commands` change can no longer leave `aria-activedescendant` pointing past the end of the list for a render. `MultiSelect.SelectAll` adds keyboard activation (Space/Enter) and `tabIndex`, so the `role="checkbox"` control is operable even when the child is a non-button (WCAG 2.1.1). `Toast` drops the redundant per-toast `aria-live` (the alert/status role already implies politeness) and makes the toaster container a single persistent live region so polite toasts announce reliably.
- bc6b946: Two headless a11y fixes. `NavigationMenu` submenus now follow the WAI-ARIA menu pattern: Escape and ArrowLeft close the submenu and return focus to the parent trigger (focus was previously left on the now-unmounted item, dropping to `<body>`), and leaf submenu items — not just items with children — handle ArrowLeft/Escape to collapse a level. `RangeSlider` now clamps each thumb against its neighbor instead of sorting the pair after the fact, so driving one thumb past the other no longer swaps thumb identities and corrupts per-thumb `aria-valuenow`/`aria-valuemin`/`aria-valuemax`.
- b49d6a0: Fix two headless overlay bugs. `useClickOutside` now accepts an `ignore` ref (or array) whose clicks count as "inside"; the listener fires on `mousedown`, which previously raced the trigger's own `click` toggle so clicking a trigger while open dismissed then immediately reopened the surface. Popover and Menu now pass their trigger ref, and Combobox/MultiSelect pass their input/anchor ref, so a trigger can close the surface it opened. `CommandPalette.Root` now renders its body inside `Dialog.Content` instead of the context-only `Dialog.Root`, so the palette is actually modal — focus trap, scrim, Portal, Escape-to-close, and `aria-modal` — as its documentation promised; it also no longer renders inline when closed. `dismissOnEscape`/`dismissOnScrimClick` are exposed on `CommandPalette.Root`.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Patch release rolling up 32 bug, security, and accessibility fixes from a full-codebase audit (issues #81–#111 and follow-up #143).

  Highlights: fixed a `Box` conditional-hook crash on style-prop toggles; `Show`/`Hide` now react to viewport resize; default themes ship the `durations`/`easings`/`animations` scales so the `animation` prop resolves; the compiler now matches the runtime's class output (pseudo-override lifting + canonical rule order); Calendar/TreeView keyboard navigation moves real DOM focus; Combobox/Select can be cleared to `undefined`; and `themeToCssBlock` escapes the theme name (CSS-injection hardening). Plus React-Native layout-animation/theme-persistence/loading-indicator fixes, numerous headless a11y fixes (Dialog, Menu/ContextMenu, HoverCard, NavigationMenu), and compiler/codemod/build-script robustness fixes. See the v1.1.2 release notes for the full list.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix four issues surfaced while dogfooding v1.1.0:
  - **react-native:** ship the `@usemotif/react-native/reanimated` driver subpath. It was documented but never built or exported, so consumers could only reach the JS-thread fallback driver (#75).
  - **react:** `useDrag` now returns a passthrough `Wrapper` on web, matching native, so the documented cross-platform drag recipe works on web instead of throwing (#78).
  - **react:** overlays (Dialog, Drawer, Popover, Menu, Tooltip, …) now carry the active theme across the portal boundary, so token CSS variables resolve in portaled content instead of painting transparent (#77).
  - **headless:** `Calendar` ships built-in grid layout, so the month renders as a 7-column grid out of the box instead of a vertical line, and `DatePicker` forwards `style` to the inner calendar (#79).

## 1.1.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync. No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the motion-system roadmap across the rest of the `@usemotif/*` packages.

> Renamed from `@motif-js/headless` in v3 as part of the `@motif-js/*` → `@usemotif/*` consolidation.

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Version sync. No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the cross-platform `Button` fixes ([#22](https://github.com/foo-stack/usemotif/issues/22)) for version uniformity across the workspace.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.** New cross-platform `useReducedMotion()` hook — `matchMedia` on web, `AccessibilityInfo` on native. The exit transition skips its exit phase and the native Toast skips its fade-in when the user prefers reduced motion.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Fresh v1.0.0 on the `@usemotif/*` scope.** No behaviour change in this package; bumped to track the workspace rebrand (renamed from `@motif-js/headless`). See the [v2 → v3 migration guide](https://usemotif.dev/migrating/v2-to-v3).

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- **v2 cut: package rename across the workspace.** No behavior change in this package; bumping the major together with the rest of the linked group to track the renames of `@motif-js/react-web` → `@motif-js/react` and `@motif-js/react` → `motif-js`. See the [v1 → v2 migration guide](https://usemotif.dev/migrating/v1-to-v2).

## 1.7.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.7.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#170). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the M-6 grid + transform style props for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.6.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.6.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#160). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the M-5 responsive cascade fix for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.5.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.5.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#150). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the M-4 container-query declaration props for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.4.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.4.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#140). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the M-3 display-prop additions for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.3.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.3.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#130). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the chrome-tier additions for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.2.0

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/core@1.2.0](../core/CHANGELOG.md#120). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the runtime-emission additions for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Version sync with [@motif-js/compiler-swc@1.1.2](../compiler-swc/CHANGELOG.md#112). No behavioral changes in this package; released alongside the compiler fix for version uniformity across all `@motif-js/*` packages.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- **Publish-pipeline fix.** v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 shipped with `workspace:*` strings unrewritten in their published `dependencies` because `scripts/publish.mjs` invoked raw `npm publish` instead of `yarn npm publish` (Yarn 4 only rewrites workspace deps when going through its own publish command). Both broke installs with `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL`. v1.1.1 ships with the script fixed; published manifests now resolve `workspace:*` to concrete versions.

## 1.0.0

### Minor Changes

- 8ac4dd5: **Primitives buildout.**

  35 new primitives ship on both renderers. Same prop schema, same
  behaviour where the platform supports it, deliberate divergence
  (with comments) where it doesn't. Every primitive composes the
  existing Box / Pressable / Text foundation, so theme + responsive
  - pseudo-state plumbing all flow through automatically.

  Layout: `ZStack`, `Spacer`, `Center`, `Wrap`, `AspectRatio`,
  `Grid`, `Flex`, `SafeArea`.

  Typography: `Heading` (level 1–6), `Paragraph`, `Code`, `Kbd`,
  `Blockquote` (with optional `cite`).

  Interaction: `Button` (full variant × intent × size matrix +
  loading / icon slots / fullWidth), `IconButton` (square Button +
  required a11y label), `Link` (`<a href>` web; `Linking.openURL`
  native; auto-injects `rel='noopener noreferrer'` on
  `target='_blank'`).

  Media: `Avatar` (image-with-initials fallback), `Icon` (token-
  sized SVG wrapper), `Svg` (typed primitive with Phosphor-friendly
  defaults). Plus a 12-icon starter set in `@motif-js/icons`: Plus,
  X, Check, ChevronUp / Down / Left / Right, Search, Trash, Heart,
  Star, ArrowRight. The full ~200-icon Phosphor-inspired set lands
  as a v0.4.x patch.

  Scroll & lists: `ScrollView` (direction / hideScrollbar),
  `Sticky` (web only — RN's `stickyHeaderIndices` integration is a
  follow-up), `VirtualList` (prop shape shipped; v0 renders non-
  virtualised so the eventual Virtuoso / FlashList integration is
  a drop-in).

  Forms: `Input`, `TextArea`, `NumberInput`, `PasswordInput` (all
  forwardRef'd; PasswordInput ships with a togglable eye), and the
  Field family — `Field` / `Label` / `FieldHelp` / `FieldError` /
  `Fieldset` — that auto-wires `aria-describedby` / `aria-invalid`
  / `aria-required` so callers get a11y right by default.

  Overlay & a11y: `Portal` (web `createPortal`, native `<Modal
transparent>`), `Overlay` (full-viewport scrim + tap-outside
  hook), `VisuallyHidden` (sr-only span web; zero-size accessible
  Box native), `LiveRegion` (`aria-live` / `accessibilityLiveRegion`),
  `FocusScope` (autoFocus + restoreFocus on mount/unmount; full
  Tab-cycling trap arrives with Dialog), and `Show` /
  `Hide` for declarative responsive visibility.

  Style-prop schema gains 17 new entries: `outline*` (5: outline,
  outlineStyle / Width / Color / Offset) for focus rings, and
  `border{Top,Right,Bottom,Left}{Width,Style,Color}` (12) for
  per-side border control needed by Blockquote and other
  typography accents.

  `@motif-js/react` re-exports the full primitive surface so
  cross-renderer apps import from a single package; package-field
  routing picks the right implementation per platform.

  What's not in this release:
  - **Real virtualisation** (Virtuoso / FlashList) for
    `VirtualList`. v0 renders every item; the prop shape is final
    so callers don't migrate when the integration ships.
  - **Native sticky headers via `stickyHeaderIndices`**. Native
    `Sticky` is a documented passthrough today.
  - **Real `react-native-svg` integration** for native `Svg` /
    `Icon`. v0 accepts a `SvgComponent` prop where callers can
    pass `Svg` from `react-native-svg`; the default is a sized
    Box that's useful for testing / emoji fallback.
  - **Tab-cycling focus trap** in `FocusScope`. v0 only
    autoFocuses + restoreFocuses; full Tab cycling lands with
    `Dialog` / `AlertDialog`.
  - **Full ~200-icon Phosphor-inspired set**. 12-icon starter
    ships now; the rest lands as a v0.4.x patch.

  Workspace test count: 469 → 491 passing + 3 skipped. New tests
  focus on Button (web 17 / native 8), layout extras (web 9 /
  native 8), typography (web 8 / native 7), IconButton + Link
  (web 10 / native 4), media (web 10), forms (web 10).

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a63a59b: **Compiler.**

  motif-js's progressive compiler ships. The runtime keeps working as
  before; opt-in compile-time extraction folds static motif call sites
  into baked `style` + `className` + at-rule CSS, and the runtime
  fast-paths the result. Compiled output is **byte-identical** to what
  the runtime would render, so half-compiled half-runtime apps dedupe
  to one set of `m-<hash>` classes rather than two.

  What's in:
  - **`@motif-js/compiler-core`** — the renderer-agnostic analysis
    layer. Babel-AST classifier (`classifyJsxAttributes`) splits each
    motif JSX call site into static / partial-static / dynamic;
    `evaluateLiteral` pulls compile-time values out of strings,
    numbers, negative numerics, no-substitution template literals,
    object/array expressions, and `const`-bound identifiers with
    literal initialisers. `extractWeb` produces the inline style +
    class name + at-rule CSS by reusing `@motif-js/core`'s
    `resolveResponsiveStylesToVars`, so compiler and runtime always
    agree. `extractNative` extracts literal-only base values; tokens
    and responsive overrides stay at runtime since theming + viewport
    are dynamic on native. Differential parity is proven against 15
    of the 18 cross-renderer standard cases (3 Pressable pseudo-state
    cases skipped — they need a separate extractor and land in a
    later release).

  - **`@motif-js/compiler-babel`** — the canonical Babel plugin (164
    code-only LOC). Walks JSX, drops consumed style props, merges
    baked `style` / `className` into any user-supplied attribute
    (user values win, mirroring the runtime's
    `{ ...baseStyle, ...inlineStyle }` merge). Aggregates per-file
    CSS through an `onCss` callback so host build tools can route
    it to a stylesheet output.

  - **`@motif-js/compiler-swc`** — universal bundler shim (107 LOC)
    via `unplugin@3`. Despite the package name it's not an SWC plugin
    (those have to be WASM); it exposes `vite` / `rollup` / `webpack`
    / `rspack` / `esbuild` / `farm` builders from one source, all
    routing to the canonical Babel pass. Layers BEFORE the host's
    SWC pass when used with Next or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`.

  - **`@motif-js/compiler-metro`** — Metro/Expo wrapper (41 LOC).
    Default-exports a function returning a `[plugin, options]`
    Babel-tuple ready to drop into `babel.config.js`'s `plugins`
    array. `target` defaults to `'native'`. Future StyleSheet
    hoisting will land here.

  - **Box fast-path** in `@motif-js/react-web`. After the babel plugin
    strips static style props, `rest` carries no style props, so
    `<Box>` early-returns a plain `createElement(as, ...)` instead
    of routing through the resolver + class-injection round-trip.
    Cascades to Stack / HStack / VStack / Text / Pressable since they
    all delegate to Box. The slow path is unchanged for
    runtime-only callers.

  - **Shared CSS-emission helpers** moved into `@motif-js/core`
    (`hashAtRules`, `buildAtRulesCss`, `stringifyDeclarations`, etc.).
    Both runtime and compiler consume the same source — the parity
    guarantee is structural, not aspirational.

  Performance, measured on a 200-Box render-heavy bench
  (`benchmarks/render`):
  - runtime: 1,096 hz (mean 0.91 ms / render). 1.00× baseline.
  - compiled: 1,895 hz (mean 0.53 ms / render). **1.73× faster**.
  - vanilla `<div>`: 2,303 hz (mean 0.43 ms / render). 2.10× faster
    (theoretical floor). Compiled closes 80% of that gap.

  What's not in:
  - Wrapper-stripping (replacing `<Box>` with `<div>` in compiled
    output) — would push compiled speedup higher. Open lever for a
    future release.
  - Pseudo-state extraction (`_hover` / `_focus` / `_active`) on
    Pressable — bring the 3 skipped differential cases into the
    passing set in a later patch.
  - Native StyleSheet hoisting in `compiler-metro` — currently the
    native target is a Babel-side no-op while the runtime keeps
    resolving styles. Future minor will hoist a single
    `StyleSheet.create({...})` per file.
  - Cross-library bench rows (Tamagui, NativeWind, Stitches) —
    legitimacy data, not a release gate.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fc38fd6: **Native parity.**

  `@motif-js/react-native` reaches feature parity with the web renderer.
  The same prop schema, the same theming model, the same responsive
  shapes, the same container-query semantics — running on RN's
  `StyleSheet`, with theming via JS context, and container queries
  polyfilled via `View.onLayout`.

  The cross-renderer conformance suite (`@motif-js/test-utils`'
  `standardCases`) passes 18/18 against **both** renderers' adapters.
  "Same input → same resolved values" holds across the two trees.

  What's in:
  - **`@motif-js/react-native`** — `Box`, `Stack` / `HStack` / `VStack`,
    `Text`, `Pressable`, `Image`, `Container`, `ThemeProvider`,
    `<Theme name>`, `useTheme` / `useThemeName` / `useViewportWidth` /
    `useContainerInfo`. Same prop schema as `@motif-js/react-web`;
    literal-mode style resolution (no CSS variables — RN doesn't have
    a CSS cascade equivalent).
  - **Viewport-driven responsive resolution** — every responsive shape
    (object / array / DSL) resolves against the current viewport width
    via `Dimensions.addEventListener('change', …)`. Same mobile-first
    cascade as web. Re-renders on rotation / split-screen / window
    resize.
  - **Container-query polyfill** — `<Container name?>` measures itself
    via `View.onLayout`, exposes width via React context.
    `@<bp>` / `@<name>.<bp>` keys resolve against the matching
    container's width. `rateCapMs` prop tunes re-measure throttle
    (default 16ms = 1 frame; opt out with `0`).
  - **`@motif-js/test-utils`** — `RendererAdapter` contract is unchanged
    from v0.1; the native renderer ships its own adapter with the
    package's tests.

  What's not in:
  - Native renderer is published as JS source + types only — no
    pre-built dist for the native target (Metro transforms motif's
    source directly via the `react-native` field in `exports`).
  - Visual regression (Detox + Playwright) — deferred to v0.8+.
  - Bare RN demo app — Expo Router demo at `apps/playground-native`
    covers the same surface.
  - Compiler — still placeholder stubs.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8321b3e: **v0.1.0 — first public preview** (web-only).

  The initial npm publish. The web renderer is feature-complete;
  native and the compiler are placeholders. Treat as **pre-alpha** — APIs may
  shift before v1.

  What's in:
  - **`@motif-js/core`** — token resolver, style-prop schema, theme types,
    responsive (object / array / DSL), media + container queries.
  - **`@motif-js/react-web`** — Box, Stack, Text, Container, Pressable,
    Image. ThemeProvider with CSS-variable theming and nestable
    sub-themes. SSR collector with Sync + AsyncLocalStorage backends.
    Conformance + snapshot test infrastructure.
  - **`@motif-js/react`** — re-exports the web primitives + `styled()`
    factory (variants + compoundVariants).
  - **`@motif-js/tokens`** — opinionated default light / dark themes plus
    validation fixtures for Primer, Atlassian, and Material 3.
  - **`@motif-js/test-utils`** — `ConformanceCase` / `RendererAdapter`,
    `standardCases`, `assertConformance`, `motifMatchers`.
  - Stub packages (`react-native`, `compiler-*`, `primitives`, `forms`,
    `headless`, `icons`, `color`, `reset`) ship with package metadata but
    no runtime yet — placeholders for upcoming releases.

  What's not in:
  - Native renderer
  - Static compiler
  - Headless components and full primitives roster
