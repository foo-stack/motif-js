/**

 * every one of them public API in a fixed-version package. The cost of listing
 * names is that a name can be added to the client chunk and never reach anyone,
 * or a part can be left wired to nothing. These tests turn both into failures.
 *
 * Nothing here is a hardcoded list of parts. The invariant is derived from the
 * namespaces the barrel actually builds, so converting another component keeps
 * it honest without anyone remembering to update a fixture.
