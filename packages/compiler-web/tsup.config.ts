 * ESM only, deliberately.
 *
 * `unplugin` publishes a single `"."` export pointing at an `.mjs` file and no
 * `require` condition, so there is no CommonJS build of it to link against.
 * This package used to emit CJS and advertise a `require` condition anyway,
 * which meant `require('@usemotif/compiler-web')` threw ERR_REQUIRE_ESM from
 * inside a dependency: a promise the manifest could not keep.
 *
 * Bundling the dependency instead was tried and is worse. It takes the output
 * from 4.7 KB to 139 KB, and still fails at load, because unplugin reads
 * `import.meta` which has no meaning in a CommonJS bundle.
