/**
 * Deriving `$`-reference types from a theme's token tree.
 *
 * These are types only; nothing here emits runtime code. They exist so a
 * consumer's theme can drive what a `$` reference is allowed to say, instead
 * of every reference being the opaque `TokenRef` (`` `$${string}` ``).
 *
 * The source has to be a literal token object, normally `typeof myTheme`
 * from {@link createTheme}. A declared interface cannot work: `TokenScale`
 * carries `[key: string]: TokenNode<V>`, and an index signature puts `string`
 * back into `keyof`, which collapses every derived union to `string`.

/**
 * The union of dotted leaf paths through a token tree.
 *
 * Object nodes recurse; every other node is a leaf. A token whose value is
 * itself a `$` reference is a leaf too, because a `TokenRef` is a string:
 * `{ primary: '$colors.brand.500' }` yields `'primary'`, not a path into the
 * reference it points at.
 *
 * Numeric keys are included because token scales are routinely keyed by
 * number (`space.4`, `colors.gray.500`). TypeScript widens those keys to
 * their string form inside a template literal, which is what callers want:
 * the emitted reference is `$space.4`.
 *
 * @example
 *   type P = Paths<{ brand: { 500: '#3b82f6' }; fg: '#000' }>;
 *   //   => 'brand.500' | 'fg'

 * union of every scale's paths measured 8 to 9 times the type-check cost of
 * the per-scale form at realistic call-site volume, and it is the one shape
 * choice here that matters for performance.
