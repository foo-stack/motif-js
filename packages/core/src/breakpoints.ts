 *
 * Examples:

 * - `"base:$2 md:$4 lg:$8"` → `{ base: '$2', md: '$4', lg: '$8' }`
 * - `"@card.md:row"` → `{ '@card.md': 'row' }`
 *
 * Returns `null` if the input does not parse as a valid DSL — every token
 * must have form `<knownKey>:<rest>`, with a non-empty value. The caller
 * should fall back to treating the input as a literal value in that case.
 *
 * Numeric values are coerced from string to number when they parse
 * cleanly (no unit suffix). `"md:8"` → `{ md: 8 }`; `"md:8px"` →
 * `{ md: '8px' }`. This matches the mental model of writing the
 * equivalent object form.
 *
 * **Precedence / ambiguity.** When a string prop value parses as a valid
 * DSL it is interpreted as responsive, *taking precedence over a literal
 * interpretation*. In practice this is unambiguous: no valid CSS value is
 * shaped like `<breakpoint>:<value>` (e.g. `md:1fr`), so a string that
 * parses here was almost certainly written as the DSL. The guards below
 * keep real literals out: a token whose key isn't a known breakpoint /
 * container key (so `url(http://…)`, `rgb(0, 0, 0)`, `1fr 2fr`, …) returns
 * `null`, and so does anything containing `;`, `{` or `}` (which appear in
