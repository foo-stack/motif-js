/**
 * `rename-v2` codemod: rewrite v1 motif-js import specifiers to their
 * v2 names.
 *
 * | v1                       | v2                  |
 * |--------------------------|---------------------|
 * | `@motif-js/react-web`    | `@motif-js/react`   |
 * | `@motif-js/react`        | `usemotif`          |
 * | `@motif-js/react-native` | `@motif-js/react-native` (unchanged) |
 *
 * (`usemotif` is the v2 meta package. The original plan published it
 * as the unscoped `motif-js`, but npm blocked that name as too
 * similar to an existing `motif.js` package; the rename landed on
 * `usemotif`, which mirrors the docs domain at <usemotif.dev>.)
 *
 * The rewrite is applied to the **entire** file text — appropriate for
 * source and `.json` files (import statements, `require()`, dynamic
 * `import()`, and the `dependencies` keys of `package.json`). It is a
 * whole-file string replace, NOT an import-scoped one, so any other
 * occurrence of the old specifier (a comment, a string literal used as
 * data) is rewritten too. The CLI scopes `.md` / `.mdx` files to code
 * regions only (fenced blocks + inline code) so prose mentions of the old
 * name — changelog entries, migration notes — aren't rewritten.
 *
 * ## Sequencing trap
 *
 * The two rewrites overlap. If we naively replace `@motif-js/react` →
 * `usemotif` first, then `@motif-js/react-web` → `@motif-js/react`,
 * the first pass already destroyed every `@motif-js/react` occurrence
 * — including the `@motif-js/react` part of `@motif-js/react-web`,
 * leaving garbage like `usemotif-web`.
 *
 * So we use a one-pass single regex with alternation that matches
 * whichever of the two source names appears at the call site:
 *
 *   /@motif-js\/react-web|@motif-js\/react(?![-\w/])/g
 *
 * — for each match, decide the replacement based on the matched text.
 * react-web → @motif-js/react, bare react → usemotif. The negative
 * lookahead `(?![-\w/])` on the bare-react branch ensures we don't
 * catch react-web / react-native / react-foo (the `-` exclusion) or
 * the `@motif-js/react/server` and `@motif-js/react/tanstack-virtual`
 * subpaths (the `/` exclusion). Those subpath exports still belong
 * to the renamed DOM bindings package and must survive untouched.
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 *
 * The two rewrites collide across runs: `@motif-js/react-web` →
 * `@motif-js/react` lands on a name that the *other* rule treats as a
 * v1 aggregator. So a second run would promote that just-renamed
 * `@motif-js/react` (now the v2 DOM bindings) all the way to
 * `usemotif` (the meta package) — silently corrupting it. `String`
 * alone can't distinguish "v1 aggregator" from "already-migrated v2
 * DOM bindings"; the same `@motif-js/react` text is valid in both.
 *
 * The guard: a bare `@motif-js/react` is only promoted to `usemotif`
 * when the file shows **no v2+ specifier** ({@link ALREADY_V2_MARKER}
 * — an unscoped `usemotif` import or any `@usemotif/*` v3 scope). Once
 * a file contains such a marker — which is exactly what this transform
 * itself emits when it rewrites a v1 aggregator import — any remaining
 * `@motif-js/react` is read as the v2 DOM bindings and left alone. So
 * `applyRenameV2(applyRenameV2(x)) === applyRenameV2(x)` for every file
 * that mixes aggregator and DOM-bindings imports (the realistic case),
 * and a whole-project rerun no longer corrupts.
 *
 * Residual: a file importing *only* `@motif-js/react-web` (and nothing
 * from the v2 meta package) carries no `usemotif` marker after the
 * first pass, so a second pass on that isolated file would still over-
 * migrate its now-bare `@motif-js/react`. Run the codemod once; the
 * `--dry-run` flag previews changes without writing.

 * (the leading `@motif-js/` namespace) that false positives in prose
 * are rare. For `.md` / `.mdx` / `.json` files this lets the same
 * transform handle install snippets, code fences, and the
 * `dependencies` keys of package.json without separate parsers.
 *
 * If the input is `package.json`, sub-path imports like
 * `@motif-js/react/server` survive (the lookahead spares them) — the
 * `/server` and `/tanstack-virtual` exports still belong to the
